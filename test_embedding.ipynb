But more than surprising us, errors in statistical thinking, Downey shows, can have a huge impact.

Colin started at Amazon in 1998; Bill joined in 1999. In Working Backwards, these two long-serving Amazon executives reveal and codify the principles and practices that drive the success of one of the most extraordinary companies the world has ever known. With twenty-seven years of Amazon experience between them, much of it in the early aughts-a period of unmatched innovation that brought products and services including Kindle, Amazon Prime, Amazon Studios, and Amazon Web Services to life-Bryar and Carr offer unprecedented access to the Amazon way as it was refined, articulated, and proven to be repeatable, scalable, and adaptable. With keen analysis and practical steps for applying it at your own company-no matter the size-the authors illuminate how Amazon's fourteen leadership principles inform decision-making at all levels and reveal how the company's culture has been defined by four characteristics: customer obsession, long-term thinking, eagerness to invent, and operational excellence. Bryar and Carr explain the set of ground-level practices that ensure these are translated into action and flow through all aspects of the business. Working Backwards is a practical guidebook and a corporate narrative, filled with the authors' in-the-room recollections of what \"Being Amazonian\" is like and how it has affected their personal and professional lives. They demonstrate that success on Amazon's scale is not achieved by the genius of any single leader, but rather through commitment to and execution of a set of well-defined, rigorously-executed principles and practices-shared here for the very first time\"--",

In this work Einstein intended, as far as possible, to give an exact insight into the theory of Relativity to those readers who, from a general and scientific philosophical point of view, are interested in the theory, but who are not conversant with the mathematical apparatus of theoretical physics. The theory of relativity enriched physics and astronomy during the 20th century. When first published, relativity superseded a 200-year-old theory of mechanics elucidated by Isaac Newton. It changed perceptions. For example, it overturned the concept of motion from Newton's day, into all motion is relative. Time was no longer uniform and absolute, as related to everyday experience. Furthermore, no longer could physics be understood as space by itself, and time by itself. Instead, an added dimension had to be taken into account with curved space-time. Time now depended on velocity, and contraction became a fundamental consequence at appropriate speeds.",

One by one, I recognize the same mistakes in me.

Whether you're online, in a classroom, an office, a town hall -- or just hoping to get through a family dinner with a stubborn relative -- dialogue shuts down when perspectives clash. Heated debates often lead to insults and shaming, blocking any possibility of productive discourse. Everyone seems to be on a hair trigger. In How to Have Impossible Conversations, Peter Boghossian and James Lindsay guide you through the straightforward, practical, conversational techniques necessary for every successful conversation -- whether the issue is climate change, religious faith, gender identity, race, poverty, immigration, or gun control. Boghossian and Lindsay teach the subtle art of instilling doubts and opening minds. They cover everything from learning the fundamentals for good conversations to achieving expert-level techniques to deal with hardliners and extremists.

In Dataclysm, Christian Rudder uses it to show us who we truly are. For centuries, we’ve relied on polling or small-scale lab experiments to study human behavior. Today, a new approach is possible. As we live more of our lives online, researchers can finally observe us directly, in vast numbers, and without filters. Data scientists have become the new demographers. In this daring and original book, Rudder explains how Facebook \"likes\" can predict, with surprising accuracy, a person’s sexual orientation and even intelligence; how attractive women receive exponentially more interview requests; and why you must have haters to be hot. He charts the rise and fall of America’s most reviled word through Google Search and examines the new dynamics of collaborative rage on Twitter. He shows how people express themselves, both privately and publicly. What is the least Asian thing you can say? Do people bathe more in Vermont or New Jersey? What do black women think about Simon & Garfunkel? (Hint: they don’t think about Simon & Garfunkel.) Rudder also traces human migration over time, showing how groups of people move from certain small towns to the same big cities across the globe. And he grapples with the challenge of maintaining privacy in a world where these explorations are possible. Visually arresting and full of wit and insight, Dataclysm is a new way of seeing ourselves—a brilliant alchemy, in which math is made human and numbers become the narrative of our time.",

Why do we assume a good-looking person will be more competent? The answer lies in the two ways we make choices- fast, intuitive thinking, and slow, rational thinking. This book reveals how our minds are tripped up by error and prejudice (even when we think we are being logical), and gives you practical techniques for slower, smarter thinking, enabling you to make better decisions at work, at home, and in everything you do.",

These cells revolutionized medical research, contributing to countless scientific breakthroughs including the polio vaccine, cancer treatments, and gene mapping, while Lacks and her family remained unknown and received no financial benefits. The book interweaves scientific history with the personal story of the Lacks family, raising profound ethical questions about medical consent, racial inequality, and who owns the rights to human biological materials.",

Taleb argues that history is dominated by these outlier events rather than gradual developments, yet humans consistently fail to account for them due to cognitive biases and overreliance on past patterns.

         "From the world-leaders in strategic thinking and the multi-million copy bestselling authors of Thinking Fast and Slow and Nudge, the next big book to change the way you think. Imagine that two doctors in the same city give different diagnoses to identical patients - or that two judges in the same court give different sentences to people who have committed matching crimes. Now imagine that the same doctor and the same judge make different decisions depending on whether it is morning or afternoon, or Monday rather than Wednesday, or they haven't yet had lunch. These are examples of noise: variability in judgements that should be identical.In Noise, Daniel Kahneman, Olivier Sibony and Cass R. Sunstein show how noise produces errors in many fields, including in medicine, law, public health, economic forecasting, forensic science, child protection, creative strategy, performance review and hiring. And although noise can be found wherever people are making judgements and decisions, individuals and organizations alike commonly ignore its impact, at great cost.Packed with new ideas, and drawing on the same kind of sharp analysis and breadth of case study that made Thinking, Fast and Slow and Nudge international bestsellers, Noise explains how and why humans are so susceptible to noise and bias in decision-making. We all make bad judgements more than we think. With a few simple remedies, this groundbreaking book explores what we can do to make better ones.",

So wrong that a chimpanzee choosing answers at random will consistently outguess teachers, journalists, Nobel laureates, and investment bankers. Professor and TED presenter Hans Rosling, together with his two long-time collaborators, Anna and Ola, offers a radical explanation of why this happens. They reveal the ten instincts that distort our perspective. It turns out that the world, for all its imperfections, is in a much better state than we might think.

Un professore tedesco di filosofia, Eugen Herrigel, vuole essere introdotto allo Zen e gli viene consigliato di imparare una delle arti in cui lo Zen da secoli si applica: il tiro con l'arco. Comincia così un emozionante tirocinio, nel corso del quale Herrigel si troverà felicemente costretto a capovolgere le sue idee, e soprattutto il suo modo di vivere. All'inizio con grande pena e sconcerto. Dovrà infatti riconoscere prima di tutto che i suoi gesti sono sbagliati, poi che sono sbagliate le sue intenzioni, infine che proprio le cose su cui fa affidamento sono i più grandi ostacoli: la volontà, la chiara distinzione fra mezzo e fine, il desiderio di riuscire. Ma il tocco sapiente del Maestro aiuterà Herrigel a scrollarsi tutto di dosso, a restare \"vuoto\" per accogliere, quasi senza accorgersene, l'unico gesto giusto, che fa centro quello di cui gli arcieri Zen dicono: \"Un colpo, una vita\". In un tale colpo, arco, freccia, bersaglio e Io si intrecciano in modo che non è possibile separarli: la freccia scoccata mette in gioco tutta la vita dell'arciere e il bersaglio da colpire è l'arciere stesso.",
